# TODO

- Support showing history (git log and git log -p) of specified branch
- Support rebasing a branch off of the latest master (it auto pulls latest master before rebasing)
- Support merging a branch into master after rebasing the latest master (automation of multiple git commands)
- Consider supporting the idea of automatically detecting which trunk a branch is branched off of and being able to trigger a rebase simply without having to specify the target trunk to rebase
- Support navigating to an older revision within the same branch with autocomplete
